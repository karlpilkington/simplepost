J. David Blackstone wrote a program called tinyhttpd in 1990 for a
networking class and posted it on SourceForge. This program is based on
tinyhttpd 0.1.0, the first (and only) release.

xorangekiller modified tinyhttpd in 2012 to create the first version of
SimplePost. Basically, it was updated to better support Linux and use
newer POSIX standards, ported to C++ so it can be easily embedded into
other applications, and stripped of CGI support since CGI is largely
irrelevant in 2012.
