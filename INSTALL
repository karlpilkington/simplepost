Basic Installation
==================

    There is no configure script or installation support provided with this
program at the moment. To compile, `cd` into the root of the source directory
and run `make`. To install, simply run `make install` or `sudo make install`.

    By default the program will be installed to /usr/local/bin and the manual
will be installed to /usr/local/share/man/man1. You can modify the base
installation directory, /usr/local by default, by setting the PREFIX variable.
For example, `sudo make PREFIX=/opt/simplepost install` will install the binary
to the /opt/simplepost/bin directory.

    Most BSD, GNU/Linux, or other free software distributions need to control
where packaged software is installed. This can be done using the PREFIX
variable documented above, but that is not always desirable. The DESTDIR
directory can also be used to control the master installation directory.
Specifically DESTDIR should be used if you want to install this program into a
local (non-root) directory structure. For example if this program was packaged
for Debian, this varialble could be used in the debian/rules file as follows
`sudo make DESTDIR=debian/tmp PREFIX=/usr install`.

Build Dependencies
==================

    Although this program is farily light-weight, it does link against a few
external libraries besides the C standard library. SimplePost also requires the
POSIX threading library (libpthread), the magic file type determination library
(libmagic), and the GNU embedded HTTP server library (libmicrohttpd) to be
installed. On Debian, Ubuntu, or most other Debian-based distributions, you can
satisfy these dependencies by running the command `sudo apt-get install -y
build-essential libpthread-stubs0-dev libmagic-dev libmicrohttpd-dev`.

Compilers and Options
=====================

   Since there is no configure script provided with this package, compilation
is performed using hand-written makefiles. So long as your environment is
reasonably standard, you should be able to compile this software on any POSIX-
compliant system using the method described above. It has been tested on the
latest stable version of Debian with both the GNU C Compiler and the LLVM/Clang
C Compiler with a GNU toolchain.

    By default the master makefile will try to compile this program with GCC.
You can specify a different C compiler using the CC variable. For example, to
compile SimplePost with Clang you could run `make CC=clang build` from the
top-level source directory or the src/ directory.

    There are extensive ancillary informational messages and additional sanity
checks which may be very useful for debugging purposes built into this program,
but they are disabled by default because they can degrade its performance and
marginally reduce the number of clients it can handle simultaneously. (Plus the
large number of debug messages can be a little overwhelming.) Debug mode can be
enabled by setting the DEBUG variable at compile time. For example,
`make CC=clang DEBUG=1 build` will compile SimplePost in full debug mode using
the Clang C compiler.
