Allow entire directories to be hosted, not simply individual files. There are
a few ways to handle this, and I'm not sure which would be best. One option
would be to recursively search the directory and host all files in it, then
display a web page listing all the files in the directory (with hyperlinks,
obviously) when it is requested by a client. Another option would be to gzip
the directory and serve the archive to the client when it is requested.

Add IPv6 support to the server. Most modern POSIX networking functions have the
support included already, but it needs to be explicitly enabled in the HTTP
server. It would probably be a good idea to also give the user the choice of
using IPv4, IPv6, or both.

Add configuration file support. It would be nice to be able to launch
SimplePost with a pre-determined set of files to serve. The program does not
need to be capable of generating this configuration file, but it obviously must
be able to parse it. Like most UNIX configuration files, SimplePost's config
file should be easy to edit by hand. A well-commented default config file, or
at least an example, should be created for this feature. Explicit documentation
would also be good. Libconfig is probably the best, least error-prone way to
implement this support. http://www.hyperrealm.com/libconfig

Implement support for custom URLs. Currently URLs are designated by the
SimplePost HTTP server. While they work and are fairly readable, it would be
nice to be able to specify a custom URL for a file. simplepost_serve_file()
already implements this feature, it just need to be exposed to the user.
