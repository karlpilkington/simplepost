Add support to the front-end for serving mutiple files simultaneously.
The SimplePost class is capable of this already, but the program is not.

Allow entire directories to be hosted, not simply individual files. This
support can be handled externally by other programs making use of the
SimplePost class, but it would be cleaner to integrate it instead.
Integration would also allow the front-end program to handle directories
so the user no longer has to resort to gziping them prior to being
served.

Add IPv6 support to the server. Most modern POSIX networking functions
have the support included already, but it needs to be explicitly
integrated into the server class.
