SimplePost is a lightweight HTTP server for embedded applications. The
program provided in this package allows single files to be served over
HTTP a predetermined number of times. The SimplePost class, however, is
more versatile and allows multiple files to be served simultaneously
and errors to be handled more discreetly. While this program is intended
to be a feature-complete front-end for the SimplePost class, its use as
an embedded web server in other programs was considered in the design.

The server is HTTP 1.1 compilant, but it does not implement the entire
specification. Since it was only intended to be a simple file server, it
handles that use case well, but has no support for scripting and other
advanced features of modern web servers. Unimplemented features are
handled gracefully by sending the client a '501 Method Not Implemented'
error message.
