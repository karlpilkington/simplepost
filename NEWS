* Noteworthy changes in release 0.2.0 (2013-03-31) [stable]

** Serve more than one file simultaneously

  While this probably seems like an obvious addition, more than one file
  can now be served simultaneously! There are two ways to do this. The
  first - and easiest - is to specify more than one file on the command
  line. The second is to add files to a running instance of the program
  using the '--pid' switch.

* Noteworthy changes in release 0.1.0 (2012-12-20) [stable]

** Intial release

  Since this is the initial release of SimplePost, there are no changes
  of note. See the README for release details; EVERYTHING's NEW!
